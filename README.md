# CTFs

Various writeups for solved CTF (capture the flag) challenges, either for practice, fun or profit (as of 29.03.23, no profit was made; also, the profit part is a joke; or is it?; no, it is; or is it?; it is).

## Structure:
- picoCTF: Challenges done on the [picoCTF](picoctf.org) platform of Carnegie Mellon University.
  - picoGym: practice challenges inside the [picoGym](https://play.picoctf.org/practice) practice section
  - picoCTF2023: actual CTF writeups for the picoCTF2023 challenge (14-28.03.23), as performed by yours truly or various members of team Pedram
