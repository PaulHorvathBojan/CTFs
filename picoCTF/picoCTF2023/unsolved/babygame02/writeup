1. 367 'a' characters cause no segfault when input in the program, 368 do.
2. After decompilation in ghidra, the program shows a "win" function that prints the flag.
3. "win" is not called from "main" in case of reaching the end (or any other case, really, there is no call to "win" from "main").
4. Idea: build a buffer overflow attack to overwrite EIP with a call to the "win" function.
