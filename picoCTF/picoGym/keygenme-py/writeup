1. After a number of runs playing with the interface, nothing special happens.
2. Open keygenme-trial.py in IDE (or vim).
3. Observe the following lines:
	key_part_static1_trial = "picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_"
	key_part_dynamic1_trial = "xxxxxxxx"
	key_part_static2_trial = "}"
4. menu_trial() function calls enter_license() upon pressing c -- the other options are either unavailable or nothing special changes.
5. enter_license() calls check_key(user_key, bUsername_trial), and on success, decrypts full version of program.
6. check_key(user_key, bUsername_trial) checks that:
	- key fits length
	- key fits template
	- mid part of key is made out of hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8]
7. Run hashlib.sha256(b"FREEMAN").hexdigest()[1:9] in python and store result (could be anywhere really, even don't clear the screen after running in terminal).
8. Flag will be picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_hashlib.sha256(b"FREEMAN").hexdigest()[4, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, 8]} (I put it in keygenme-trial.py with option b just in case).
