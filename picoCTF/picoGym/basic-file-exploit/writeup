1. Open program-redacted.c in vim.
2. An educated guess would be that the flag to be captured is in the flag variable (line 15).
3. Reopen program-redacted.c in some editor that supports CTRL + F; CTRL + F "flag".
4. Occurences of variable flag at declaration point and line 144: puts(flag) if the data_read entry number cannot be converted to a base 10 number.
5. From here on, reasonably easy:
	- insert some value in the database with option 1
	- call option 2 and when prompted to insert entry number send some non-strtollable string (I used "one") -> flag
