1. Open svg file in browser.
2. Open inspector.
3. Expand recursively the second group.
4. Flag will be at the end of the last expanded elements.
5. Alternatively, if you pay really close attention and have a very low dpi mouse and steady hands, you can find selectable text in the very middle of the image and copy paste it to get the flag.
