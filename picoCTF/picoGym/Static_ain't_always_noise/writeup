1. Run 'vim static' in terminal -> no idea what's inside, quite illegible.
2. Run 'vim ltdis.sh' in terminal -> looks like it's calling objdump on input file and also extracting strings.
3. Run 'ltdis.sh static' -> strings file and x86_64 file.
4. Look inside static.ltdis.string.txt until you find flag.
