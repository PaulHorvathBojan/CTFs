1. I'll be honest, after I did my master thesis on applying fully-homomorphic encryptoin, I expected going to the wikipedia page on homomorphic encryption would not help at all without further knowledge.
2. Unless you can at least guess or infer the cryptosystem used for encryption, nothing will work.
3. Challenge description says "Cookies can Be modified Client-side", among other things, with precisely CBC capitalized -> can reasonably safely assume we're talking about AES-CBC (if it's DES, you could probably crack it as is with some effort, and hints suggest you can't).
4. In good keeping with picoCTF tradition, assume this is similar to other challenges, and hence the cookie would be something of form admin=0 (or it contains this), and we would have to switch the 0 to a 1.
5. Google "flip bit aes cbc" or similar.
