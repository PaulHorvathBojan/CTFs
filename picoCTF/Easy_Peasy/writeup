1. Observe that the max size of the OTP is 50000 and the keys are used by rotation.
2. The idea is to use up all the keyspace and reuse exactly the length of the ciphertext, then XOR and recover plain.
3. Script in expl.py.
4. Observation: flag is not in the expected format (not picoCTF{} wrap), and must be unhexed.
