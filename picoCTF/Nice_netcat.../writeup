1. Run 'nc mercury.picoctf.net 22342' in terminal -> get a bunch of numbers separated by returns.
2. Copy numbers, put them into cyberchef (https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) on magic setting -> flag.
(They are ASCII numbers of printable characters, and cyberchef can convert them  quicker than me).
